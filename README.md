# SmartStudy
Smart Study is an Android App for students, that helps them study smarter and more structured. 
It creates an optimal study-plan for the user, taking into account what day the user wants to begin learning, relevant deadlines and difficulty or learning volume.

The user can add new exams,  edit existing exams, add a timetable, set the available time for each weekday as well as exceptions and adjust settings for perfect individual learning behaviour.

SmartStudy offers various in-app exercises to learn both languages and math. 
It's possible to create new vocabular collections and practise them as well as test the users knowledge.

On the apps main overview page it shows the user todays timetable and todays studyplan. Once the user gets started on their daily studyplan and focuses, the remaining required study time decreases and the user is able to check off their To-Dos.
